## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Life Well Spent is a side project of [XDoubleU](https://github.com/XDoubleU).

I love to plan in my goals on a yearly, quarterly and weekly basis. 
To do so I have always used Project Management software, these contain lots of features and I only use the bare minimum functionality.
In order to make my own life a bit easier (and also to work on yet another side project) I decided to start this beauty.

You can always check out the current project and give any feedback you want!
